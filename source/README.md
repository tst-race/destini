# SRI RaceBoat Plugins

This is the source directory for SRI RaceBoat plugins.  As of 12
Feb. 2024, there are only TWO "distribution" plugins available:

1) PluginTA2SRICLIEncoding in subdir 'encoding'
2) PluginTA2SRIFlickrTransport in subdir 'flickr_transport'

The first plugin implements steganographic encoding and decoding.  The
second plugin implements the Flickr transport.

All other directories are development / alpha test sandboxes.  Note
that mjpg_encoding is meant for stegging into a finite motion jpeg
file, while mjpg_transport will set up a streamer and steg into that.
