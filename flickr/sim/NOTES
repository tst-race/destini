From Flickr board, with regard to video quality:

Hi ed ed,

We see the original file is encoded at 11MBps; since for SD video we
transcode at a bit rate of 694Kbps, artifacts can be expected during
our transcode process since we're stepping the video down (11MB >
694Kbps). So, it might be a good idea to use video editing software
(such as Windows Movie Maker, which is free for Windows users) to
compress the video using a lower bitrate.

If you did record video in HD, we do use a higher bitrate during the
transcode (2MBps), so that is one benefit of recording in HD (and we
have the ability to transcode at 4MBps, too, here).

Unfortunately, that particular type of video (mostly black and
shadows, moving water) will show any compression artifacts more than a
different subject, but yes, there can be a decrease in quality during
transcode depending on the tech details of the video uploaded.

A rough rule of thumb (which we can add to the FAQs), is the following:
- Encode no higher than 2MBps for SD, 5MBps for HD 
- use H.264
- use 30 frames per second
- use deinterlace

the following streams are produced for sharing at flickr (besides
mobile and appletv ones)

a) 640x480@700kbps h.264, mp4 container (90sec) (that is ~2.30
bitrate/pixel ratio)

b) 1280x720@2Mbps (90sec) h.264, mp4 container, if video is 720p+
(that is ~2.20 bitrate/pixel ratio)

HD video in our case is higher resolution though quality will be lower
comparing to 640x480 that has better bitrate/pixel ratio (more
artifacts, i.e. more big blocks in case of lower ratio). we are
working on transcoding quality issues and planning to change default
bitrates.

recommended video settings:

* 640x480 SD or 1280x720 HD

* bitrate: 1000-2000kbps for SD, 3000-4000kbps for HD. AFAIK, we don’t
  do any video pre-processing (noise reduction etc.), thus video with
  high bitrate and lots of noise (small moving parts) will have more
  artifacts after transcoding.

* Deinterlacing - use progressive mode (check camera settings), always
  deinterlace.

* frame rate: 25 or 30 is nice, this makes video playback “smooth”,
though consumes bitrate, i.e. lower framerate might improve picture
quality but affects playback.  Posted ages ago. ( permalink )
